## What I Want To Do

I plan to run a OSR (Old School Renaissance) game as a way to fill in weeks where my primary campaign doesn't have enough players. The game is structured to allow anyone to turn up and start playing from **a pre-generated stable of existing characters.** It allows people with a difficult schedule to pop in when they can and serves as an easy onboarding to new players that can't (yet) commit to an entire campaign. It also allows a group of disparate players to come together at short notice for a fun evening together around a virtual table.

The goal is to explore the vast (No, honestly, REALLY vast!) dungeon that is the long abandoned dwarven clanhold of Brazenthrone. Each session a party is created from whatever players are able to participate and the goal is to explore and map as much of the city as possible and then GET BACK OUT before the end of the session. Thus restoring the status quo and allowing the next session to continue with possibly a different set of players with possibly a different cast of characters. Hopefully exploring deeper and deeper into the perilous labyrinth each session.

## Some points about how i plan on running these games:
<br>

#### Theatre of the mind
primarily so that minimal prep is required for tokens/maps etc. There is actually a full map and as the city is explored I will release pictures showing what has been discovered so far.
There will be a VTT during combat to demonstrate party layout and represent monsters
#### Pregenerated Characters
Unless you are particularly keen on a single individual then you are not committed to playing the same character each session. The trading post outside the rediscovered city will always be well populated with a large cast of eager adventurers. With new arrivals plugging any gaps that may arise...
#### The Darkness
Your most terrifying foe is the darkness itself. Brazenthrone is not lit. Darkvision is not a thing races have. As well as their strict real-time time limit, dropped torches can sputter out. 
Guard the lights carefully if you ever hope to see daylight again.
#### High Leathality
In OSR, deadly clashes are the norm. Combat will be absolutely brutal and often short lived. Running is often preferable to fighting.
#### Paper/PDF and Dice
are players way of interacting with the world. No online tools other than a Discord account required. Dice are rolled by players and the result announced. Character sheets are likely to be form-fillable PDF and will be kept and updated by the player for the session. There are digital tools available https://shadowdarklings.net/ if you prefer.
#### Descriptive Locations
for evocative atmosphere. I plan to paint a detailed picture of the environment as much as possible.
#### Supplies and Equipment
will MATTER. Your characters will need to specify what they plan to carry with them into the depths. How much they can physically lift as well as what they choose can mean the difference between glorious success and ignominious death. 
#### Character Death
A players new character will be able to rejoin the party at the same character level (but they will have lost all XP for that level and will start the session with the same amount of gold as any new character)
#### Random Tables
will frequently be used to greatly assist the DM in reducing session prep. This often can result in fights or even treasures that are way above your current abilities.
#### A Collaborative Experience
is what we are aiming for. All ideas are welcomed and even hoped for. Your DM will always appreciate constructive feedback and ideas for improvement.
#### Start of Session
Each session will start at the old trading post outside the city. This trading post has been recently patched up and a rough adventures guild has been created to allow parties to meet and form groups together. Also serving to supply these hopeful adventurers with the bare minimum of equipment they will need to tackle the dangers of Brazenthrone.  
#### The 3 Pillars
Naturally this style of game will favour combat and exploration over roleplaying but I'm hoping most challenges presented will have multiple solutions including talking your way out of (and likely into) trouble.

### Each newly created character will be issued with:
**2d6x5** gold pieces (gp). To be spent on any equipment you might want from the vendors around the trading post.
A generic "Crawling Kit" is also available for 7gp and contains all the basics a fresh faced adventurer might need.

### Rules about transferring assets between characters
Fallen comrades will either:
1. leave the gear where they died (assuming their cause of death doesn't claim it!) for future expeditions to discover.
2. If the survivors of their party are willing and able their gear can be returned to the players heirs and successor
3. Stealing a dead players equipment is generally frowned upon by the community... If that matters to your character
### There are three ways in which a gaming session can end:
1. The players can, at any time of their choosing, make their way out of the dungeon and end the session for the evening.
2. The DM can simply announce that we will stop playing in 1 hour. If, by the end of the hour, the PCs have made their way out of the dungeon, the session ends normally.
3. But if they have not made their way out of the dungeon (for whatever reason), then the Escaping the Dungeon! tables will be used to determine their fate.

## The Location

*The dwarvern city of Brazenthrone has been rediscovered! Lost for centuries the abandoned city's front gate has been recently located and a consortium of interested parties is funding a exploration/mapping/monster clearing effort to render the city safe for dwarvern settlers to move back in, restart the mines and restore the city. They are looking for hardy adventurous types to mount exploratory missions into the unknown labyrinthine reaches of the the abandoned city. Legends say that the city was considered fabulously wealthy before its mysterious demise and likely contains huge quantities of treasure (both gold, gems and other more miraculous items.) But it wont be easy. The city is unlit, sprawling, filled with dangers and unknown peril.

*Are you up to the challenge?*

## The Game System

In an attempt to move a little away from D&D 5e and experiment with alternative RPG gaming systems. I intend to run a OSR game that plays a bit more like the older systems of D&D like BECMI that I grew up with.

### Shadowdark

_Shadowdark RPG_ is what old-school fantasy gaming would look like after being redesigned with 50 years of innovation. 
https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark

The game is fast, familiar, intuitive, and deadly. It’s built for sword-and-sorcery adventures where fell monsters slither in darkness and frosty gems glint upon forgotten thrones, waiting to be discovered.

In _Shadowdark RPG_, real time comes into play. **A torch only holds back the looming darkness for one hour of actual game time!** There isn't a moment to spare when your only light source is guttering low...

Characters use a slot-based system to organise what they are carrying. Slots are limited and hard choices may be necessary in order to bring out treasure from the Shadowdark.
