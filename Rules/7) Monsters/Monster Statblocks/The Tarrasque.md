name: The Tarrasque
layout: Shadowdark Monster
image:
description: A colossal, four-legged reptile with crocodilian jaws, amber scales, and a diamond-hard, spiked carapace. It towers overhead like a mountain, able to swallow entire villagesn one gulp. The tarrasque hibernates deep in the earth or at the bottom of the sea for centuries, only awakening long enough to fill its vast belly in an indiscriminate rampage of terror and destruction. There is only one tarrasque, and it is the most dreaded creature to walk the earth.
