description: A floating mass of rubbery skin crusted with barnacles. Its ten eyestalks writhe like snakes, and a deep, circular scar mars its central body, blinding what was once a largeye above a lipless maw. The Ten-Eyed Oracle stalks the Shadowdark, burbling mad prophesies and somehow moving freely between the lightless fathoms of the earth. The keepers of the deep lore suspect The Ten-Eyed Oracle was once a benevolent ally of mankind, but an unknown calamity drove it to insanity and reckless hatred.
