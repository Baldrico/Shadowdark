## **Magic Item Qualities**

### **Unique.** 
All magic items should be distinct from each other. Magic is mysterious, and so should be each magical dagger or spell scroll. Give them personalities, strange curses, or unique appearances.

### **Power Level.** 
A magic item's benefits should each be roughly equivalent to a class talent in power and scope. Magic items can be mighty, but they should rarely eclipse what a character can contribute.

### **Nature of Effects.** 
Magical effects that are passive riders (ongoing effects that always apply) are easier for players to manage than effects that need to be activated or that add a lot of additional rolls to gameplay.

Avoid effects that could easily go forgotten or bog down the pace of the game by adding frequent checks or rolls.

## Game-Breakers

When designing magic items, there are several things to consider that can heavily impact Shadowdark RPG's core systems.

### **Darkvision or Light.** 
Use extreme caution with effects that obviate the need for torches or the light spell. Such effects remove the time pressure and resource management of tightly limited light sources.

Magic items should not glow indefinitely or provide an unlimited way to see in the dark.

### **Gear Slots.**
The amount of gear a character can carry ties into the time pressure of light sources and the importance of careful gear selection.

Enhancing gear slots can reduce these core challenges to mere speed bumps. Access to such effects should be rare and limited.
