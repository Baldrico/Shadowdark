Alignment defines your role in the clash between good and evil. All creatures are connected to the eternal conflict waged by Law, Chaos, and Neutrality, whether they know it or not.

- [[Lawful|Law]] is benevolence, 
- [[Chaotic|Chaos]] is malevolence
- [[Neutral|Neutrality]] is impartial, favoring neither.
