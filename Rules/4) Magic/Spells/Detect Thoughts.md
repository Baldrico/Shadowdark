>[!note] Description
> You peer into the mind of one creature you can see within range. Each round, you learn the targetâ€™s immediate thoughts. On its turn, the target makes a Wisdom check vs. your last spellcasting check. If the target succeeds, it notices your presence in its mind and the spell ends. "Magic is simply the art of doing and undoing." -Creeg, human wizard
