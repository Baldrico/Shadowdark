>[!note] Description
> You transform a creature you touch into another natural creature you choose of equal or smaller size. Any gear the target carries melds into its new form. The target gains the creature's hit points, armor class, and attacks, but retains its intellect. If the target goes to 0 hit points, it reverts to its true form at half its prior hit points. You can target any willing creature with this spell, or an unwilling creature whose level is less than or equal to half your level rounded down (minimum 1).
