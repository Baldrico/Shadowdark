>[!note] Description
> An invisible, near-sized cube of null-magic appears centered on you. Within the cube, no spells can be cast. Magic items and spells have no effect in the zone, and no magic can enter. The cube moves with you. Spells such as dispel magic have no effect on it. Another antimagic shell does not affect this one.
