>[!note] Description
> You issue a verbal command to one creature in range who can understand you. The command must be one word, such as “kneel.” The target obeys the command for as long as you focus. If your command is ever directly harmful to the creature, it may make a Charisma check vs. your last spellcasting check. On a success, the spell ends.
