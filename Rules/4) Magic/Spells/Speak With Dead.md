>[!note] Description
> A dead body you touch answers your questions in a distant, wheezing voice. You can ask the dead body up to three yes or no questions (one at a time). The GM truthfully answers "yes" or "no" to each. If you cast this spell more than once in 24 hours, treat a failed spellcasting check for it as a critical failure, instead.
