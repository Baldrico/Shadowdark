>[!note] Description
> You throw the divining bones or peer into the blackness between the stars, seeking a portent. You can ask the GM one yes or no question. The GM truthfully answers "yes" or "no." If you cast this spell more than once in 24 hours, treat a failed spellcasting check for it as a critical failure, instead.
