>[!note] Description
> Send a strobing orb of energy streaking toward a target within range. Choose an energy type from fire, cold, or electricity. The orb deals 3d8 damage and delivers a concussive blast of the chosen energy type. If the energy type is anathema to the target's existence, the orb deals double damage to it.
